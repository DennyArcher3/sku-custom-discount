## Deployment Overview

Your SKU Custom Discount app has been successfully deployed to Cloudflare Workers!

### Deployment Details

- **Worker URL**: https://sku-custom-discount.eromage3.workers.dev

- **Partner Dashboard**: https://partners.shopify.com/3359641/apps/269949796353/versions/679529480193

## Architecture

### 1. Cloudflare Worker (Simplified Redirect Approach)
Based on the CLOUDFLARE_DEPLOYMENT_CORRECT.md documentation, we implemented a simple redirect worker that:
- Handles health checks
- Redirects OAuth callbacks to Shopify
- Proxies API requests
- Acknowledges webhooks

### 2. Resources
- **KV Namespace**: Sessions storage (ID: 8b252d829fc1454182e2c6814bdcae2e)
- **D1 Database**: sku-discount-db (ID: 0ce2dfcb-1c94-4ee8-b630-8349cc9a54b3)
- **Compatibility Date**: 2025-01-27

### 3. Environment Variables
All required environment variables are configured in wrangler.toml:
- SHOPIFY_API_KEY
- SHOPIFY_API_SECRET (stored as secret)
- SHOPIFY_APP_URL
- SHOPIFY_DISCOUNT_FUNCTION_ID
- SCOPES

## What's Working

1. **Cloudflare Worker**: Deployed and accessible at the public URL
2. **Shopify Configuration**: Updated with Cloudflare URLs for:
   - Application URL
   - OAuth redirect URLs
   - Webhook endpoints (including GDPR compliance webhooks)
3. **App Version**: Successfully released to Shopify Partner Dashboard

## Next Steps for App Store Submission

## Key Files

- `/worker.js` - Cloudflare Worker entry point
- `/wrangler.toml` - Cloudflare configuration
- `/shopify.app.toml` - Shopify app configuration
- `/app/shopify.server.ts` - Shopify app server configuration

## Monitoring

View worker logs:
```bash
wrangler tail
```

View worker metrics in Cloudflare Dashboard:
https://dash.cloudflare.com/

## Important Notes

1. The worker uses a redirect approach as documented in CLOUDFLARE_DEPLOYMENT_CORRECT.md
2. This avoids the complexity of handling OAuth directly in the worker
3. The approach maintains consistent URLs throughout the app lifecycle
4. GDPR compliance webhooks are configured using the `compliance_topics` field

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check worker logs with `wrangler tail`
2. Verify environment variables in wrangler.toml
3. Ensure URLs match between Cloudflare and Shopify configurations
4. Check that the worker is active in Cloudflare dashboard

Congratulations on your successful deployment! ðŸŽ‰
