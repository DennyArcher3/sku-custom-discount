‚ùå Can't do variant-specific automatic discounts  

### After Custom Variant Discounts:

## Quick Pitch for App Review Team:

**The Problem:** Merchants create 50+ different discounts to handle variant-specific sales. Hours wasted. Impossible to manage. Customers confused by multiple codes.

**Our Solution:** ONE discount (automatic or code) with different rates per variant. Set it once. "SALE2025" gives lower discount on Medium, higher on XL. That's it.

**Why Now:** Post-pandemic inventory challenges + smarter consumers = merchants need surgical precision, not sledgehammers.

**Market Need:** Every fashion store needs this. Every store with variants wants this. The "aha!" moment sells itself.

**Technical Excellence:** Built on Shopify Functions. Integrated directly into Shopify's native discount interface. No external UI - it's seamless.
