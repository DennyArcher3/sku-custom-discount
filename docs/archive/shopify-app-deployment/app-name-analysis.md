# App Name Analysis & Recommendations

## Current Name Analysis
**SKU Custom Discount**
- Length: 18 characters ✅
- Pros:
  - Contains "SKU" - searchable keyword
  - Contains "Discount" - primary function
- Cons:
  - "Custom" is vague - doesn't communicate the unique value
  - Doesn't emphasize the precision/targeting capability
  - Doesn't stand out from generic discount apps

## Market Research Findings

### Competitor Naming Patterns
1. **Action-oriented**: "Boost", "Manager", "Control"
2. **Feature-specific**: "Bulk", "Volume", "Flash"
3. **Professional indicators**: "Pro", "Plus", "Hub"
4. **Benefit-focused**: "Smart", "Easy", "Automatic"

### Gap in the Market
- No major apps specifically emphasize SKU-level targeting
- Most apps focus on broad discount types (BOGO, bulk, collections)
- Your unique angle: Precision targeting at the SKU/variant level using Shopify Functions

### 2. **SKU Discount Pro**
- **Length**: 16 characters
