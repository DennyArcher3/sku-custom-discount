# Production Deployment Checklist for Shopify App Store

## Current State ‚úÖ
Your app is working perfectly in development! Now let's prepare for production and App Store submission.

## Key Differences: Development vs Production

### Development Store
- Uses temporary Cloudflare tunnel URLs
- `automatically_update_urls_on_dev = true` handles URL changes
- Function IDs are generated dynamically
- Testing environment only

### Production/App Store
- Requires stable, permanent URLs
- Fixed configuration that doesn't change
- Consistent function IDs
- Must pass Shopify review process

## Production Deployment Steps

### 1. Choose Your Production Hosting ‚ö°

Since you tested successfully, you have 3 options:

#### Option A: Cloudflare Workers (Recommended)
```bash
# Deploy command
wrangler deploy

# Result: https://sku-custom-discount.YOUR-SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev
```

#### Option B: Traditional Hosting
- Heroku, Railway, Render
- Result: https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com

#### Option C: Custom Domain
- Any hosting + your domain
- Result: https://discount.yourdomain.com

### 2. Environment Variables for Production üîê

You need to set these BEFORE deploying:

```env
# Required for Production
SHOPIFY_API_KEY=3122acfb32ed2de15a381bde53864f1f
SHOPIFY_API_SECRET=[your-secret-from-partner-dashboard]
SHOPIFY_APP_URL=https://your-production-url.com
SCOPES=read_cart_transforms,read_discounts,read_products,write_discounts,read_metaobjects,write_metaobjects

# For your discount function
SHOPIFY_DISCOUNT_FUNCTION_ID=[will be generated on deploy]
```

### 3. Get Your Function ID üéØ

Your app uses a function ID for the discount URL. To get it:

```bash
# After deploying your app
shopify app deploy

# Look for output like:
# Deployed function: discount-function
# ID: 01J6ABC123DEF456
```

Then add to your environment:
```env
SHOPIFY_DISCOUNT_FUNCTION_ID=01J6ABC123DEF456
```

### 4. Update shopify.app.toml üìù

Change from development URLs to production:

```toml
# Before (Development)
application_url = "https://sydney-walnut-metropolitan-cheers.trycloudflare.com"

# After (Production)
application_url = "https://your-production-url.com"

[auth]
redirect_urls = [
  "https://your-production-url.com/auth/callback",
  "https://your-production-url.com/auth/shopify/callback",
  "https://your-production-url.com/api/auth/callback"
]

[[webhooks.subscriptions]]
uri = "https://your-production-url.com/webhooks/app/scopes_update"
# Update all webhook URLs...
```

### 5. Deploy Configuration to Shopify üöÄ

```bash
# This updates Shopify with your production URLs
shopify app deploy --reset

# This generates the final configuration
shopify app config push
```

### 6. Update Partner Dashboard üè™

1. Go to [partners.shopify.com](https://partners.shopify.com)
2. Select your app: "SKU Custom Discount"
3. Update:
   - App URL: `https://your-production-url.com`
   - Redirect URLs (all 3)
   - Webhook URLs (all 5)

### 7. Test Production Deployment ‚úÖ

Before submitting to App Store:

1. **Fresh Install Test**
   ```
   - Uninstall from dev store
   - Visit: https://your-production-url.com
   - Install and test discount creation
   ```

2. **Function Test**
   - Create a discount
   - Verify it appears in "Apps" section
   - Test discount application

## Common Production Issues & Fixes

### Issue: URLs still showing Cloudflare tunnel
**Fix**: Set `automatically_update_urls_on_dev = false` for production

### Issue: Environment variables not working
**Fix**: Ensure they're set in your hosting platform, not just .env file

### Issue: Discount creation URL fails
**Fix**: Check `SHOPIFY_DISCOUNT_FUNCTION_ID` is set correctly

## Production Environment Variables Summary

```bash
# Cloudflare Workers
wrangler secret put SHOPIFY_API_KEY
wrangler secret put SHOPIFY_API_SECRET
wrangler secret put SHOPIFY_DISCOUNT_FUNCTION_ID

# Heroku
heroku config:set SHOPIFY_API_KEY=xxx
