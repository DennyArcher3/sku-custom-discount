# Final State: Clean Setup Without Polyfill Hacks

## What We Fixed:

### 1. **Removed Polyfill Hacks** ✅
- Removed polyfills from `vite.config.ts`
- Removed polyfills from `vite.config.cloudflare.ts`
- Build still works perfectly!

### 2. **Restored Shopify Future Flags** ✅
```javascript
future: {
  v3_webhookAdminContext: true,
  v3_authenticatePublic: true,
  v3_lineItemBilling: true,
  unstable_newEmbeddedAuthStrategy: true,
},
```

### 3. **Current State:**
- ✅ UI improvements (discounts table, settings page)
- ✅ Staging/production deployment scripts
- ✅ Clean vite configs without hacks
- ✅ Proper Shopify configuration
- ✅ Build succeeds

## Development Options:

### For Local Development:
```bash
# Option 1: Use wrangler (Recommended - real Workers runtime)
npm run dev:cf

# Option 2: Use Shopify CLI (if you need OAuth flow)
npm run dev
```

### For Staging:
```bash
npm run deploy:all:staging
```

### For Production:
```bash
npm run deploy:all:production
```

## What's Different from 12 Hours Ago:

1. **Good Changes (Keep):**
   - UI improvements in discounts page
   - New settings page
   - Staging/production deployment setup
   - Deployment scripts in package.json

2. **Reverted Changes:**
   - Removed polyfill hacks
   - Restored Shopify future flags
   - Cleaned up tunnel configurations

3. **Mixed State (But Works):**
   - Have both Prisma files and D1 config
   - App will use D1 in production/staging
   - Can use either for local dev

## Is It Safe to Deploy?

**YES!** The current state:
- Builds successfully ✅
- No hacky polyfills ✅
- Production configs unchanged ✅
- Only adds features (UI improvements) ✅

## Recommended Next Steps:

1. Deploy to staging and test thoroughly
2. If everything works, deploy to production
3. For future: Consider fully migrating from Prisma to D1 for consistency
